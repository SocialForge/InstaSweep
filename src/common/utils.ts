/**
 * When writing a switch-case with a finite number of cases, use this function in the
 * `default` clause of switch-case statements for exhaustive checking. This will make
 * TS complain until ALL cases are handled. For example, if we have a switch-case
 * in-which we evaluate every possible status of a component's state, if we add this
 * to the default clause and then add a new status to the state type, TS will complain
 * and force us to handle it as well, thus avoiding forgetting it.
